The repository contains a script for the R programming language for translating nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial genes of three species (Acanthogammarus victorii, Eulimnogammarus vittatus, Gmelinoides fasciatus ) of endemic amphipods from Lake Baikal, taking into account the remolding of transfer RNA genes.
